#   NPM_TOKEN=<your npmjs access token> ./scripts/publish.sh        # bump patch if needed
#   NPM_TOKEN=<token> ./scripts/publish.sh minor                    # force a minor bump
#   NPM_OTP=<6-digit code> NPM_TOKEN=<token> ./scripts/publish.sh   # 2FA accounts (non-automation tokens)
#
# The token is read from the environment only — it is never written to a
# file. Accounts with 2FA "auth and writes" must pass NPM_OTP (or use an
# Automation token, which bypasses the one-time password).
